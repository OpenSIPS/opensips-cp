CDRviewer Tool
----------------------

Description
----------------

It shows Call Detail Records(CDRs) from the database. You have the possibility 
to filter CDRs and to export CDRs in csv (comma-separated values) files. 

Configuration
-------------------


* Database layer configuration file: 

opensips-cp/config/tools/cdrviewer/db.inc.php

Attributes  set in this file : 

+database host 
+database port
+database username 
+database password
+database name


* Local configuration file :  
opensips-cp/config/tools/cdrviewer/local.inc.php


Attributes like database table name, fields to be displayed, results per page 
and variables which control the way the tool exports CDRs are set in this file. 
The following variables present in this file may be subject to change more often:
$show_field  and  $export_csv. 

They are associative arrays used to configure the CDR fields that are to be 
displayed or extracted from the database. Following is an explanation of the 
meaning of these variables.


$show_field

This array controls which fields from the database are to be  displayed.  
The order in which the fields are placed in the csv file can be established  by 
modifying the array index.  

$show_field[index]['database_field_name'] = "Field Description | Field_Type";

“Field Description”  is the column description that will be displayed.

“Field_Type” must be  “int”  or “string”, depending on the type of the record  in the database. 


$export_csv

This array is used only by the cdr_exporter.php script which is a command-line 
script meant to export cdr records from the database into csv files. 
(The inner workings of this script are detailed in a different file) 
$export_csv[index]['database_field_name'] = "Field Description";
The order in which the fields are placed in the csv file can be established  by 
modifying the array index.  
“Field Description” ($export_csv)  is the column description that will show in 
the exported csv file.
The presence of field description in the csv files is optional because automated
tools might be  configured to work on this file.


Usage and Features
---------------------------

You can search by any field and use a wildcard 
( '%' - matches a set of characters ). 
The filters  “CDR Field”, “Start Date”, “End Date” can be  applied in parallel. 
With the help of this tool you can export CDR records in a csv file.
The filters applied on "Search" are working on the exported CDRs as well, so it 
exports what is displayed. 
When the “Export” button is pressed a download pop-up will show in your browser.  
There is a feature to jump to SIP traces of the call if such records 
exist (see SIPTrace module). 
The correlation between CDRs and the SIPTrace tool is done following the 
`call_id` field which is common for both cdrs and siptrace tables .
