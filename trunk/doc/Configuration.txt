OpenSIPS Control Panel (OCP) Configuration Guide 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This file shows information about the configuration of the OPENSIPS-CP.
A minimal knowledge of php is necesarry to configure it.


This file is structured as follows :


1. Global Configuration Files Description

2. Local Configuration Files Description





1. Global Configuration Files Description
-------------------------------------------------------


All configuration files are situated in a separated  directory  `opensips-cp/config`.


local.inc.php 
-----------------

This file contains some text constatnts which do not change very often.
It basically looks like this:

$login_page_title = "OpenSIPS Control Panel - Login Page";
$login_title = "OpenSIPS Control Panel";
$login_user = "Username";
$login_pass = "Password";
$login_err = "Invalid ".$login_user." / ".$login_pass;
$session_err = "Your Session has expired";

$page_title = "OpenSIPS Control Panel";
$header_title = ".: OpenSIPS Control Panel";
$copyright = "Copyright &copy; 2011 OpenSIPS Project";



boxes.global.inc.php 
----------------------------

For an easy deployment of the Opensips Control Panel , 
the "boxes.global.inc.php" file has been developed. The ideea was to keep the 
commonly used data (by multiple tools) in this file (to avoid data redundancy). 

This file contains the descriptions of the boxes (servers) that form the platform
provisioned/controlled by OpenSIPS Control Panel.

Each machine has an unique identification number ($box_id)  - for each of  them,
you must configure a set of properties, like the IP addresses of the machine, MI 
interface, MONIT interface, etc

Description of the associative arrays in the file:


//You must configure the IP address of the MI connector of opensips through this 
//array. It can be a XMLRPC host:port pair (ex: 127.0.0.1:8080 ) or a fifo file 
//(/tmp/opensips_fifo)
//If the machine does not have a MI you can leave this  blank. 

$boxes[$box_id]['mi']['conn']="127.0.0.1:8080";

//You must configure the IP address of monit through this array:
//the next three variables are somewhat self explained.

$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['conn']="127.0.0.1:2812";
$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['user']="monit_user";
$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['pass']="monit_pass";

//the monit tool can connect to a monit server over a ssl connection. 
//set 1 here if monit has ssl, otherwise put 0.

$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['has_ssl']=1;

		
//the text description of the box as it will show in mi and monit tools 
$boxes[$box_id]['desc']="Primary SIP server";

// the association ID of this machine. 
//It is ment to select the system this machine is part of. 
//If two machines are in the same system , they must have the same `assoc_id`. 

// This is  a very important parameter . Some of the tools are designed to talk to certain type of servers 
// (there can be multiple servers of the same type)
// Servers of the same type have same assoc_id - the tools will use this to identify which are the OpenSIPS servers 
// (typically for MI interaction)
// the tools that check this variable are:
// -  drouting
// -  dialplan 
// -  siptrace
// -  pdt
// -  domains 
// The so called `assoc_id` which marks the machines the tools talk to is set in the 
// local.inc.php config file (for each tool)

$boxes[$box_id]['assoc_id']=1; 



Don't forget to increment the $box_id variable as you add boxes to this array.

db.inc.php
-----------


The global configuration file helds global parameters for database connections to mysql or postgres. 
These parameters cover up all modules, unless one of themodules needs to use some other database.
The file is found in config directory and it is called db.inc.php The structure of the file is 
somewhat identical with the one of the local configuation files. The exception is that the global 
configuration file also specifies a parameter for the database driver, as shown bellow:

//database driver mysql or pgsql
$config->db_driver = "mysql";

//database host
$config->db_host = "localhost";

//database port - leave empty for default
$config->db_port = "";

//database connection user
$config->db_user = "root";

//database connection password
$config->db_pass = "mysql";

//database name
$config->db_name = "opensips"; 



globals.php
-----------

The globals.php file is used for parameters that are being accessed in more then one module.

*$config->table_aliases
Parameter used for the aliases tables in case there are more than the standard dbaliases table. The defined array has as key the
label and as value the table name.For defining more than one attribute/value pair, complete the list with identical elements
separated by comma.

$config->table_aliases = array("DBaliases"=>"dbaliases");


*$config->permissions
The permissions parameter is used by all modules, when setting the modules permissions for a certain admin.
This array has 2 values that will remain unchanged: read-only and read-write.

$config->permissions = array("read-only","read-write");

$config->admin_passwd_mode= 0/1

This array controls the way the admin password is going to be saved in the database.
Value 0 means the password will be saved as plain text string (text mode)
Value 1 means the password will be saved as MD5 (HA1) token (password field will be empty and ha1 will be calculated)



2. Local Configuration Files Description
-----------------------------------------------------


The local configuration files contain database layer connection data and other attributes that 
are specific to each tool. If the same database is being used for each module, then there 
should be used the global config file and the local one should be left as it is by default. 
If one module needs a different configuration, just uncomment the parameters and set them as needed:

These files are :

    * opensips-cp/config/tools/(admin|users|system)/toolname/db.inc.php 

The variables in this file are somewhat self explanatory.You must set up the mysql connection data 
through this file.

All db.inc.php files look the same , like this :

//database host
$config->db_host = "localhost";

//database port - leave empty for default $config->db_port = "";

//database connection user
$config->db_user = "root";

//database connection password
$config->db_pass = "mysql";

//database name
$config->db_name = "opensips";

Not all the tools require access to the database but every tool that uses the database has its own 
database configuration file.

    * opensips-cp/config/tools/(admin|users|system)/toolname/local.inc.php 

Documentation for each module can be found by following the specific link.
