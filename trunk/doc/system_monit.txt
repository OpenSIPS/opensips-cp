Monit Tool (monit)
---------------------------


Description 	
---------------


MONIT is a monitoring server (see http://www.tildeslash.com/monit ). 
The Monit tool is a centralized point of access  to the web interfaces of all MONIT servers 
configured  across the SIP platform - it shows the status of machines and processes that are 
monitored.



Global Configuration
-----------------------------


The Monit tool uses data from the global configuration file  
(global.boxes.inc.php) .

$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['conn']="127.0.0.1:2812";
$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['user']="admin";
$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['pass']="pass";
$boxes[$box_id]['monit']['has_ssl']=1;


Database Configuration File
--------------------------------------


This tool does not have a database configuration file.



Local Configuration File 
--------------------------------



The refresh time is configurable in the local configuration file 
(opensips-cp/config/tools/monit/local.inc.php ) and it defaults to 15 seconds. 



Usage and Features 
---------------------------

The tool has a drop down box with pre-configured machines
to easily switch between  MONIT servers. 
The "Force Refresh" button will instantly refresh the page. 
Using the interface you can enable or disable monitoring for each process or 
host configured to be monitored by MONIT and you can also start or stop a service.
