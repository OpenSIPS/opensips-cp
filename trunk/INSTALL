OpenSIPS Control Panel (OCP) Installation Guide 
-----------------------------------------------


You will need apache , php and a mysql server for OCP to work.

Apache
------


You need to add this entry in your httpd.conf (or apache.conf) :

Alias /cp /var/www/opensips-cp/web



If you want to use another webserver , note the OCP has been tested only 
on apache and lighthttpd.




PHP 
---


You must have PHP installed end enabled in the web server.
The MySQL support  and  XMLRPC support in PHP must be enabled. 

* php-mysql package must be installed and the mysql module loaded in php.ini.
* php-xmlrpc package must be installed and the xmlrpc module loaded in php.ini.



MySQL server 
------------

MySQL v4.1+ must be installed to create the opensips database. 
The OpenSIPS Control Panel can connect to a remote database server, 
so the MySQL server can be used from the SIP Server machine or another 
machine in the network.
