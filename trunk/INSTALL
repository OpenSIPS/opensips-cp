OpenSIPS Control Panel (OCP) Installation Guide 
-----------------------------------------------


You will need apache , php and a mysql server for OCP to work.

Apache
------

You need to add this entry in your httpd.conf (or apache.conf) :

Alias /cp /var/www/opensips-cp/web



If you want to use another webserver , note the OCP has been tested only 
on apache and lighthttpd.



PHP 
---


You must have PHP installed end enabled in the web server.
The MySQL support  and  XMLRPC support in PHP must be enabled. 

* php-mysql package must be installed and the mysql module loaded in php.ini.
* php-xmlrpc package must be installed and the xmlrpc module loaded in php.ini.



MySQL server 
------------

The OpenSIPS Control Panel can connect to a remote database server, 
so the MySQL server can be used from the SIP Server machine or another 
machine in the network.



* MySQL v4.1+ must be installed .

* You will need the opensips database schema from the opensips distribution 
(OCP is made for it)


* Additional steps:

    * for cdrviewer module : you must add a table and a stored procedure to the OpenSIPS database.

     follow these steps:	
     
	1 . install the cdr table schema cdrs.sql 
	(opensips-cp/web/tools/cdrviewer/cdrs.sql)
	mysql -Dopensips_1_4 -p < cdrs.sql 

	2. install opensips_cdrs_1_4.sql , a mysql stored procedure that generates cdrs
	from the acc table 
	
	mysql -Dopensips_1_4 -p < opensips_cdrs_1_4.sql     
	
	3. edit the cron_job/generate-cdrs.sh file and change the mysql connection data
	(hostname,username,password and database)
	
	4. you will need to call this procedure from cron at an arbitrary interval.
	here's a cron entry for a 3 minutes interval:
	
	*/3 * * * * root /var/www/opensips-cp/cron_job/generate-cdrs.sh
		
	
    * For the smonitor module : you must add two tables to the OpenSIPS database .

       follow these steps:	
    
	1. Install the monitored_stats.sql and monitoring_stats.sql tables
	You will find them in :
	opensips-cp/web/tools/cdrviewer/monitored_stats.sql	
	and 
	opensips-cp/web/tools/cdrviewer/monitoring_stats.sql	
	
	
    
	2. Add a cron job that collects data from the opensips machine(s).
	Here's a cron job that collects data at one minute interval:
	(This interval is not arbitrary , it must be set at 1 minute interval , so is the smonitor tool designed )
	
	* * * * *   root   php /var/www/opensips-cp/cron_job/get_opensips_stats.php > /dev/null
