VERSION 1.2.1: (2008-04-10)
==========
  BUGFIXES:
	* Ability to set the upper/lower bounds (regression).

	* Multiple series charts: when we go over the maximum series count, loop over color.
	* Multiple series bar chart: brown color is shown twice.
	* Pie chart : if some relative percentage is null, the whole diagram is filled in by one color.
	* Ability to use negative values in bar chart.

==========
  LICENSE:
    * Change of license to GPL v3

  FEATURES:

  REFACTORING:
	* Support for PHP4 is deprecated, as PHP 4 has reached its end of life.
	* Use of PHP5 OO constructs
    * Use of <?php tags for better server compatibility
    * Better separation of data and presentation objects, introduction of dataset objects


VERSION 1.1: (2006-04-02)
==========
  CHANGES:
